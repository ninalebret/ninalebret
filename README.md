- 👋 Hi, I’m @ninalebret
- 👀 I’m interested in research, especially in tumor immunology and immunological cancer treatments. Furthermore, I have performed internships on mast cells in eosinophilic esophagitis; a big data analysis on treatments in rheumatoid arthritis; and host gene involvement in herpes cytomegalovirus infections in human epithelial cells. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying infection and immunity, with a minor in life sciences and society, after my Bachelors in pharmaceutical sciences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on immunological topics, and diverse life science perspectives.
